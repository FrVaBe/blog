# Focus

What makes us really productive?
And what hinders us from being productive?
Many people probably feel the same way I do: distraction disturbs and focus helps.
Here are two things that help me to focus.

## Music

I can't listen to music at work.
It basically distracts me. 
So I was all the more surprised when a friend told me about the concept of "Functional Music".
He had had good experience with an app ([Brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/)) and I decided to give it a try.

I was actually very surprised at the effect the music had on me. 
It is an electronic music that keeps me busy in a positive sense, without distracting me or making me look for distractions.
The music does not distract but shields.
I listened to the music for a while with the app, but eventually cancelled the app's subscription (I didn't find the app itself that worked out either) and now playlists of this kind of music on streaming services serve me well.

It's not that I listen to music all the time now.
But when I want to consciously concentrate or sharpen my focus, then I very much like to use this tool.

## Less is more

I discovered another help to focus rather by chance.
When the weather became good enough to move one's workplace into the garden again, I unplugged my laptop and moved outside.

The working environment is not the same, of course.
Various peripherals are missing, especially the second monitor.

What I noticed, however, was, that I worked more focused without a second monitor. 
The absence of the second monitor, on which one is always inclined to communicate (chat, e-mail, ...) has definitely proved positive.
I still don't manage to actively switch it off at my regular desk, but I try to keep the number of open communication channels there to a minimum.
In any case, I was surprised that I didn't really miss anything without the second monitor - at least not when I want to work on something in a focused way.

## And what works for you?

There are, of course, tons of tips for focused work.
But is there anything unusual or surprising that works for you?
Then I would be happy to hear about it.
